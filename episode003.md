**INTRO**: Welcome to Cult of YAML - a podcast brought to you by Cloudspeakers. I’m James and I'll be your host for this podcast.

For this episode, I’d like to introduce you to Jorn Knuttila, Developer Advocate at KSOC Labs. Jorn, tell us a little about yourself and what you do:

**[INSERT JORN SELF INTRO]**

* What brought you into focusing on cloud first development as a developer?
* What’s something most people get wrong about kubernetes?
* Is kubernetes for everyone or is it just for large scale deployments?
* Where does Open Source come in when it comes to advancing cloud technology?
* What’s the future of cloud?
* Anything else you’d like folks to know before we close the episode?

**OUTRO**: Jorn, thanks so much for taking the time to join us for this episode of Cult of YAML!

For those listening, we look forward to bringing you more episodes of our podcast, so seep listening and feel free to get in touch on the Discord with your questions, comments, or episode and guest ideas.
