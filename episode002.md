**[INSERT COLE SELF INTRO]**


* What’s something most people get wrong about supply chain security?
* How royally f&%$ed are we?
* Do you think the industry is beginning to embrace standards for secure software supply chains?
* I've been really impressed at the potential implications of Witness, would you like to share anything about your work there?
* Anything else you’d like folks to know before we close the episode?

**OUTRO**: Cole, thank you so much for taking the time to join us for this episode of Cult of YAML!
